# FIFO Verification (SystemVerilog)

A synchronous **8-bit FIFO** (First-In-First-Out) design verified using a lightweight, class-based SystemVerilog testbench.  
The project demonstrates a structured approach to functional verification — including stimulus generation, driving, monitoring, and checking.

## Overview

This repository implements and verifies a **16-depth × 8-bit FIFO** using a custom environment inspired by UVM principles (without requiring the full UVM library).

The design supports:
- Write (`wr`) and Read (`rd`) operations
- FIFO status flags (`full`, `empty`)
- Synchronous reset and clocked operations

The verification environment includes:
- **Generator** – produces randomized read/write transactions  
- **Driver** – applies stimulus to the DUT  
- **Monitor** – observes DUT behavior  
- **Scoreboard** – checks correctness using a golden FIFO model  
- **Environment** – connects and coordinates all components
